# Neo Wars

Neo Wars is a new in-browser simulation of the classic Nintendo series, Advance Wars.

Neo Wars aims to provide a smooth, intuitive platform to play against opponents anywhere in the world. The primary existing option for online Advance Wars, Advance Wars By Web, has numerous flaws, and is no longer being actively developed. The goal of Neo Wars is to provide everything AWBW currently does and more, such as "real-time" style games and customizable rulesets.
