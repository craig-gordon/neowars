# Neo Wars

Neo Wars is a new browser simulation of the classic Nintendo series, Advance Wars.

Neo Wars aims to provide a smooth, intuitive platform to play Advance Wars against opponents anywhere in the world. The primary existing option, Advance Wars By Web, has numerous flaws, and is not in active development. The goal of Neo Wars is to provide everything AWBW currently does and more, such as a drag-and-drop interface, real-time style games, and customizable rulesets.
